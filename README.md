### **Machine Learning (ML) vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

**AI** is like the whole school of learning where computers mimic human intelligence. This includes everything from basic tasks to advanced problem-solving.

**ML** is a specific class within that school. It's about teaching computers to learn from data and get better over time without explicit programming.

**Examples of AI:** Siri answering your questions, computers playing chess.

**Examples of ML:** Email spam filters, Netflix recommending movies.

In short, ML is a part of AI, but not all AI is ML. ML lets machines learn from data to make decisions or predictions.
